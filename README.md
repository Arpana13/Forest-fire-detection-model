# Forest-fire-detection-model
This model is designed and developed to detect four stages offire recognition system using aerial UAV. The model mainly recognizes four types of wildire which are 
 ### Level 0 : no wildfire
 ### Level 1: Smoke only
 ### Level 2: Smoke with fire
 ### Level 3: Tremendous fire
## The 2 Key features of the model:-
### 1.Deep Learning Architecture
The model uses a CNN (Covolutional Neural Network), which has proven effective in image classification tasks.
### 2. Real-time inference
The model processes video frames in real-time, providing instantaneous feedback on the current stage of a detected fire.

## Training Data overview
The model's training dataset is curated from a combination of satellite imagery, aerial footage, and ground-based camera recordings. Annotated with meticulously labeled fire stages, this dataset captures the nuanced patterns and features crucial for accurate model predictions.
## Application Scenarios
The versatility of the Forest Fire Detection Model allows it to be integrated seamlessly into a variety of monitoring systems. From wildfire-prone regions to national parks, the model can be employed in surveillance cameras, drones, or other monitoring devices, providing a crucial layer of protection against uncontrolled fires.
## Environmental Impact
By delivering rapid and precise fire detection capabilities, the Forest Fire Detection Model contributes to minimizing the ecological impact of forest fires. Early intervention, guided by the model's insights, empowers authorities and first responders to effectively manage and mitigate potential disasters, safeguarding both natural ecosystems and human lives.

## Conclusion
In essence, the Forest Fire Detection Model stands as a testament to the potential of advanced machine learning in addressing urgent environmental challenges and fostering a proactive approach to wildfire management.
